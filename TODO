Sensing:
    Line sensing:
        ☐ Wire up color sensors
        ☐ Program moving drive train based on color sensor input
    Camera sensing:
        ☐ Find optimal resolution for sandstorm streaming
        ☐ Generate GRIP pipelines
        ☐ Run GRIP code on coprocessor or driver station
        ☐ Generate path based on camera data
